# Preparing for v3

Thanks for your continued support of my iRacing Reports Discord Bot project.

Over the past months I’ve been working away on a total re-write of the iRacing Reports Discord Bot, I’m declaring that this is version 3! They key change is that users now interact with the bot using slash commands, rather than the current !<command> style commands.

I'll be switching the bot over to the new v3 version in the final days of the 2022 Season 2 Week 13. You can read [about this new version here](https://discordbot.iracingreports.com/version3) and I have a [demo video](https://youtu.be/5YbMBCv1fVc) that you can check out to see how the new slash commands work.

To prepare for this, I need to have you complete the following 2 steps:

1. Connect your Patreon account with iRacing Reports
2. Connect your Discord account with iRacing Reports

With these steps completed, I'll be able to ensure that your driver list and any other configured options are automatically maintained during the switch over.

To begin the process, please open the following URL in a new tab:

## [https://iracingreports.com/accounts/login](https://iracingreports.com/accounts/login)

## 1) Connect your Patreon

For the iRacing Reports systems to know that you're a supporter and what tier you're on, you'll need to use a system called OAuth to connect your Patreon account with the iRacing Reports website. For more information about OAuth, you can read this excellent explanation on the Patreon support site: [https://www.patreon.com/portal/start/oauth-explained](https://www.patreon.com/portal/start/oauth-explained)

Click the **CONNECT WITH PATREON** button:

You'll enter the email address associated with your Patreon account and your password. Note, this information is sent to Patreon not us! You'll see that the URL is a patreon.com address.

With this completed, you'll be returned to the iRacing Reports website and you should see the details of your Patreon account, along with what tier you're subscribed on and your payment status.


## 2) Connect your Discord

To link up your Patreon account with your Discord account, you'll have to do a similar process with Discord.

Click the **CONNECT WITH DISCORD** button:

You can either login using the email address associated with Discord and your password, or use the [QR Code Login](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039213771-QR-Code-Login-FAQ) feature.
