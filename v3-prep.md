# Preparing for v3

Thanks for your continued support of my iRacing Reports Discord Bot project.

Over the past months I’ve been working away on a total re-write of the iRacing Reports Discord Bot, I’m declaring that this is version 3! They key change is that users now interact with the bot using slash commands, rather than the current !<command> style commands.

I'll be switching the bot over to the new v3 version in the final days of the 2022 Season 2 Week 13. You can read [about this new version here](https://discordbot.iracingreports.com/version3) and I have a [demo video](https://youtu.be/5YbMBCv1fVc) that you can check out to see how the new slash commands work.

To prepare for this, I need to have you complete the following 4 steps:

1. Connect your Patreon account with iRacing Reports
2. Connect your Discord account with iRacing Reports
3. Kick the iRacing Reports bot from your server
4. Use the new bot invite link to grant permission to "Create commands in a server"


With these steps completed, I'll be able to ensure that your driver list and any other configured options are automatically maintained during the switch over.

To begin the process, please open the following URL in a new tab:

## 1) Connect your Patreon

For the iRacing Reports systems to know that you're a supporter and what tier you're on, you'll need to use a system called OAuth to connect your Patreon account with the iRacing Reports website. For more information about OAuth, you can read this excellent explanation on the Patreon support site: [https://www.patreon.com/portal/start/oauth-explained](https://www.patreon.com/portal/start/oauth-explained)

Click the **CONNECT WITH PATREON** button:

## 4) Invite the bot back in

You'll need to do this to set up the correct permissions and have the bot create the new slash commands.
