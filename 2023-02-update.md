# Discord's change to displaying embedded images

The most obvious issue that has struck the bot recently is related to a change that Discord sprung on us to how embedded images are displayed. I've opened [a feedback thread](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/12194681062039-New-image-layout-has-broken-my-bot) on Discord's support site that explains the situation.

I've been able to implemnt some pretty quick hacks in order to alter the way that the bot was building the output images so that they're at least readable, but it's clearly something I need to address in whole new way.

Since I was forced to adjust the layouts of the output images I decided to treat this crisis as an oppotunity to take a ground up refactor of the system the bot uses to generate and display the output.

For the nerds out there, the new system I've sketched out revolves around a html template created using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) to inject the data.

The first step that I'm now 90% through was creating mock ups of the bot outputs.

# Example of a race announcement

If a race has more than 1 team member the bot will first post something similar to this:

Then for each team driver in the race the bot will create an image similar to below and add it as a message in the thread created from the overview image:

# What's next?

I'm now breaking down the mock ups I've made using the excellent online [TailwindCSS Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/kED7RP0hKS?size=562x600) IDE, into components that I'll turn into Jinja2 templates.

Until today I'd been thinking that I'd include this complete refactor of the output image system in the massive Version 4 update to the bot. The impetus of V4 is switching to the new Data API that iRacing have announced. However, this giant project is slow because I'm having to wait for the iRacing developers to add/fix the endpoints that my collection system will require to pull down race results.

Today I decided that I'd de-couple the output images refactor from V4 and instead I'd go through command by command in the production V3 bot and switch them to the new system ASAP. Mostly because I'm as sick of seeing the broken looking output that is currently displayed. With this in mind, I'll be starting on the race announcement system since it's the most ugly.
