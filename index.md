## Overview

I have created a Discord bot that interacts with my iRacing Statistics database. The bot allows users to access a range of statistical information about iRacing Series and Drivers.

You can click this link to [join the iRacing Reports Discord server](https://discordbot.iracingreports.com//discord) where the bot will respond to commands in the **#bot-playground** channel. Feel free to check out your own stats for the current season using the `/driver name: Your Name` command. Below is an example of the type of information that the bot will respond with:

You can [check out screenshots](screenshots.html) of the output from some of the other commands.

## Adding the bot to your Discord

The bot also has a range of features that support iRacing teams and communities. It is possible to add the bot to your own Discord server and configure a list of drivers to automatically include in the output of the various commands.

I have set up a Patreon page to allow people to subscribe to help cover the costs involved with running the bot.
